\# Poke Souls



A creature-battling meets Dark Souls browser game.



\## Philosophy



\- Every battle matters



\- Scars are permanent



\- Difficulty is intentional, not tedious



\- Story is environmental, not exposition



\## Tech



\- Single index.html, no build step



\- React 18 via CDN



\- Tone.js for procedural audio



\- localStorage for saves



\## Tone



\- Dark but not edgy



\- Melancholic, not grimdark



\- GBC pixel aesthetic



\- Fun for kids and adults
